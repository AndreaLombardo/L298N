# L298N Library

An easy to use L298N library to control DC Motors with Arduino.

## NOTICE

~~As you know, any L298N module has the ability to drive two motors at once, but you may not know that one instance of the library is intended to pilot only one motor. So if you need to drive two motors, you have to instantiate two L298N objects (one for each motor).~~

To instantiate both motors at once use the L298NX2 variant of the library.

L298NX2 is not a new version of module or IC,
but it stands for a double implementation of L298N library.

## INSTALL THE LIBRARY

Download this repository as a .zip file and from the Arduino IDE go to _Sketch -> Include library -> Add .ZIP Library_

## ESP32 Support

The original library is for Arduino board, using `analogWrite`, which may cause some problem on ESP32.  
Using [ESP32_AnalogWrite](https://github.com/erropix/ESP32_AnalogWrite) or [AnalogWrite_ESP32](https://github.com/pablomarquez76/AnalogWrite_ESP32) can overwrite `ledcWrite` of ESP32 to `analogWrite`.
As [pablomarquez76](https://github.com/pablomarquez76/AnalogWrite_ESP32/issues/6) saind, ESP32 has supported `analogWrite` after 2.0.11. The official document is [at here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/ledc.html?highlight=analogWrite#analogwrite).The resolution is form 0 to 255, testing normal. So nothing needs to be changed and it works well on ESP32.

## IMPORT

You can import the library in your code using the Arduino IDE going to _Sketch -> Include library -> L298N_
or directly writing the include statement in your code:

```
// For single motor instance
#include <L298N.h>
```

```
// For two motors instance at once
#include <L298NX2.h>
```

## INSTANTIATE THE MODULE

To drive a motor the first thing is to create an instance of the library.

```
// With Enable pin to control speed
L298N myMotor(EN, IN1, IN2);
```

```
// Without Enable pin with jumper in place
L298N myMotor(IN1, IN2);
```

- EN = is the Arduino pin (requires a PWM pin) connected to the Enable pin of the module
- IN1 and IN2 are the two digital pins connected to IN1 and IN2 pins of the module

### Same thing for L298NX2 variant

```
// With Enable pin to control speed

                     motor A            motor B
              |------------------||------------------|
L298NX2 myMotors(EN_A, IN1_A, IN2_A, EN_B, IN1_B, IN2_B);
```

```
// Without Enable pin and jumper in place

                  motor A      motor B
              |------------||------------|
L298NX2 myMotors(IN1_A, IN2_A, IN1_B, IN2_B);
```

## L298NX2 Methods

L298NX2 have the same methods of L298N identified by A or B suffix to drive each motor. For example setSpeed for motor A is setSpeedA and setSpeedB for motor B.

Methods without suffix, will affects both motors.
